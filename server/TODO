-save the RSS url for each source after it's determined and use later to skip the getRSS step.
-add a last updated field for each source
-create some sort of subscriber count. a few options here:
	-Create a dict of sources, count number of occurences of each source over
		all the users.
	-Do the previous thing but keep it stored in the db or in memory somewhere and
	 	have methods to update it instead of recreating each time. Might avoid the cost of above method.
	-Instead of just a subscriber count, potentially store subscribed users in 		
		their sources. Do this relationally? Or just store the info. In any case,
		this would give both a count of the users for each source AND a potential
		way to do recommendations. E.g. to get recommendations for a user, we see what
		sources they subscribe to and do some metric to figure out what other people
		subscribed to that source are subscribed to (aggregate of all of those, take
		the top ones, or something)
